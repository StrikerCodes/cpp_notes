# Learning C++

## Overview

In preparation for my Summer 2023 internship, I plan to become a proficient C++ programmer as Unreal Engine is used in the workplace, and knowwing C++ will be avaluable skill.
The purpose of this project is to record my notes as comments in executable code, where important concepts are used.

## Plan

Using GPT4 and some research, I have come up with a few criteria for being a proficient C++ programmer, and this will be the list of items that I will make sure to understand with this studying process.

1. Syntax and Semantics
	- read C++ code
	- understand rules and guidelines
2. Data Types
	- basic data types
	- type definitions
3. Control Structures
	- if-else
	- switch-case
	- for, while, do-while
4. Functions
	- define and call
	- arguments and return
	- pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference
5. Pointer and References
	- pointer syntax
	- pointer-variable interaction
6. Classes and Objects
	- OOP in C++
	- classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
7. Templates
	- using templates to write code
	- popular/commonly used templates
8. Exception Handling
	- handling errors
	- common error types
	- try - catch - throw
9. Standarad Library
	- Standard Template Library
	- commonly used classes
10. File IO
	- read from and write to files
11. Multi-threading
	- creating and handling threads
12. Best Practices
	- const correctness
	- avoid raw pointers
	- rule of Three/Five/Zero resource management
	- code formatting

## Implementation

Each major list item in the planning section will have a folder of code files. A makefile will be made to quickly compile and run each file for convenience.
Concepts of each list item will be implemented, and explenations/notes will be written in comments.
